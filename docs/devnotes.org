** Use of dotenv
To ease the process of running node apps from within the various packages, I use
dotenv (on Linux), with an '.envrc' file in each package folder (spider,
field-extractor, etc.). This puts the node_packages/.bin directory in PATH,
along with setting any other required environment variables, which makes running
tests, linting (jest and eslint), as well as command line apps easier to run when
developing.

A sample .envrc file is included in the ./docs folder

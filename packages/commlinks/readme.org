* Commlinks
Commlinks provides a set of message passing primitives, transported over Redis,
to allow communication between distributed services.

Typical patterns include:
  - Hub and Satellites, in which a central hub dispatches to and from named endpoints.

  - Chained Services, in which each service executes a function in turn, optionally passing some
    data to the next service in the chain.

  - Fan Out, in which a service dispatches to several other services

  - Fan In, in which a service awaits and aggregates the results of other services execution

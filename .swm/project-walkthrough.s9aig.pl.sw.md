## Overview
OpenMetaExtraction  is a  service provider  for OpenReview.net.  Its goal  is to
retrieve the  details of academic  research papers (e.g., abstracts,  PDF links,
authorship links), given the landing page  URLs for those papers. It consists of
a spidering package to retrieve and query a web page, an extensible set of rules
to  scrape  the metadata,  and  a  service  module  to handle  scheduled  tasks,
communication with OpenReview , and monitoring during deployment.

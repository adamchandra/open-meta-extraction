* Open Extraction Works
  A set of services to spider and extract metadata (abstracts, titles, authors, pdf links) from given URLs.

  Services may be run individually as command line applications, or as an integrated pipeline with a REST API

** Services and Commandline Applications
*** Spidering
*** Field Extraction
*** Integrated spider/extractor
*** REST Server Frontend

** Integrated Pipeline Usage


** Production machine setup and deployment
Full system deployment uses Postgres and Redis. Simplified versions of the system may be run without
Postgres and/or Redis.

Running with Postgres enables better tracking and statistics regarding success rate for spidering and metadata gathering.

Running with Redis allows the services to be run in separate node processess, which may be monitored for resource usage,
script freezing and blocking, and enables batch processing of lists of URLs to be spidered and extracted, rather than
on-demand through one-at-a-time REST requests.
